# Notes: 100 to 1 in the Stock Market
## Pattern of 100 baggers
1. Recovery from extremely depressed prices at the bottom of bear market.
   * Very rare to occur (happened in 1932/33)
2. Change in supply-demand ratio
    * E.g: Discovery of oil field can make a stock soar. Again it is kind of luck to find it.
3. Great leverage of capital structure in long periods of expanding business
   * Dual purpose fund.
4. **Reinvesting earnings at higher than avg rate of return on invested capital**
   * Maybe one can find it with enough knowledge. 

## Quality of Earnings
### Inputs
Three identical companies ``A,B,C``  
Capital: 100 million each  
Earnings: ``20%`` before tax on the invested capital  
Tax rate: ``50%``  
All the three companies wish to expand to 200 million.  
  
``A``: Issues additional shares of 100M  
``B``: Sells 8% long term bonds for 100M  
``C``: Acquires 100M of additional facilities by lease financing with 10% interest  

| Company   |  Earnings On Capital (%) after Tax | Earnings On Equity (%) after Tax | Explanation | 
| --------  | -------- | ------ |  ------ |
| ``A`` | 10 | 10 | 20% is the earnings, 50% tax on it. |
| ``B`` | 10 | **16** | 20% of 200M = 40M; 40M - 8M interest = 32M; 50% tax on 32M = 16M = 16% of equity 100M |
| ``C`` | 15 | 15 | Lease financing details do not end up in a balance sheet. 20% of 200M = 40M; 40M - 10M interest = 30M; 50% tax on 30M = 15M = 15% of equity/capital 100M |
