# Notes: 100 to 1 in the Stock Market
## Pattern of 100 baggers
1. Recovery from extremely depressed prices at the bottom of bear market.
   * Very rare to occur (happened in 1932/33)
2. Change in supply-demand ratio
    * E.g: Discovery of oil field can make the stocks soar. Again it is kind of luck to spot the company which will find the oil.
3. Great leverage of capital structure in long periods of expanding business
   * Dual purpose fund.
4. Reinvesting earnings at higher than avg rate of return on invested capital
