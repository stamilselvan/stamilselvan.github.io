The cost for the medicine differs by a huge factor based on the country we live in. In a free market, such price difference fades away automatically because of the free flow. Here it seems things are (may be unnecessarily) complicated.

For 3 dose of Rabies vaccine, it costs totally 400.69€ in Germany. Of which 284.03€ is for the actual vaccination and the remaining 116.66€ is for the handing fee to the hospital.

The same vaccination in India would [cost](https://www.1mg.com/drugs/rabipur-vaccine-143726?wpsrc=Google+Organic+Search) (₹321 x 3) + ₹450 = ₹1413. The ₹450 is the assumed handling fee. The total cost is equivalent to 16.04€ as of today's exchange rate.  This is about 25 times cheaper! It really feels odd to pay **25x** for exactly the same product/service.
