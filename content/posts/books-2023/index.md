List of book that I read and the youtube channels that I enjoyed in 2023, just as a mean to keep it recorded somewhere.  

## 1. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck (4\*)
People have only a limited amount of energy to spend. Spending energy to a stuff which is not worth, will drain the energy tank.  

## 2. Atomic Habits (4.5\*)
Make any new habit `obvious`, `attractive`, `easy`, `satisfying`. To begin with a habit, it should be a very small step that doesn't require any effort. 
Typically it should be performed within 2 mins.  
E.g: If one wants to run marathon, spend 2mins every day to wear the shoe. Have some behavior and later improve on it.
> Consistency is more important than correctness!
### Retrospective Analysis:
Looking back, I remember few small changes that transformed my and my peers life a lot. I share one such incident here. 
My 12th grade chemistry teacher Mr. Shankaran is a true gem. 
He made the dry subject very enjoyable. After being unhappy about most of our grades, he wanted to change things. 
The change he employed was simple.  

The school usually starts at 09:00. He insisted the students to come at 08:45, sit in the classroom, write test each day. 
The scope of the test is limited to 5 pages and only one question is asked from the 5 pages. 
Write the answer, handover the answer paper to the teacher and get the correction!  

It was very simple to follow, didn't need much effort to come 15 mins early (many of us were already early), no punishment if someone failed in the test. 
It was so tempting to write the tests and get feedback. 
After a couple of months, the grade for the whole classroom got improved drastically! 
The teacher might/might not know about the power of atomic habits, but he has mastered it.  

Needless to say that the teacher didn't receive any extra penny for his outstanding thinking. 
It was purely out of his passion, and I'm gifted to have such legends!  

## 3. Outliers (5\*)
Any outlier is the indirect beneficiary of the special opportunity provided too him/her. 
Be it Bill Gates or the starring Canadian sportsmen. 
Of course their personal talent and persistence matters, but on top of that the extra advantageous opportunity gave them perks.  

Among many interesting things, the one caught my eyes is 10,000 hour rule. 
Anyone who practices something for 10k hours, will definitely be a master of it! 
Forget about the quality of the stuff, focus here about the quantity. You will eventually get it there.
