# Books

## 1. Thinking, Fast and Slow (4.1*) <sub>24-Apr<sub>
On the first look, the book looked like a pillow, very thick, containing more than 450 pages.
Upon a good review by friends, I decided to delve in. I must admit that it is very dry, hard to read kind of a book.
It is similar to reading a research paper, need to devote my entire attention (System-2). 
No illustrative images/tables, like walking on bare foot in a hot summer.
This made me to prgress very slow, consuming a lot of weeks/months.

There are many “Aaha” moments, they made me reflect on myself as a decision maker, made me realize my irrational choices. 
There are pleanty of examples that provoke curiosity and put us in shame because of the cognitive error that one makes. 
From the following example, choose any one of them:

Option-A
> Would you accept a gamble that offers a 10% chance to win $95 and a 90% chance to lose $5?


Option-B
> Would you pay $5 to participate in a lottery that offers a 10% chance to win $100 and a 90% chance to win nothing?

For a rational mind, both options are the same. 
But most of the people in the survey preferred option B, because it is `framed` positive.
We might think that such trivial decisions won't have huge impact on life as a total.

For instance, if the person is in the position of choosing between having the surgery OR to seek alternative less promising approach, the following statements have different outcome even though they mean the same.
Writing-A 
> The one month survival rate is 90%.

Writing-B
> There is 10% mortality in the first month.

One scares us, while the other gives us hope. 
Of course majority of the people chose hope (Writing-A). 
This is also a trick used by advertisement agencies to manipulate people.

Overall, the book is indeed a gem, which changes the perspective of how we understand the world!

## 2. Six Thinking Hats (3.5*)  <sub>20-Jun<sub>
When a human starts thinking, usually all categories of information are poured in.
They are put forward (in a meeting) without further filtering.
The author suggests categorizing them and focusing on one category at a time.
This technique specifically directs the energy in one direction for a better outcome.

**Blue Hat:** The color of the sky.  
Sky is above everything else, it is meant to control the whole process.
Blue hat can be used at the beginning of the meeting to share the agenda and expectations for the meeting.
And also, at the end, to share the conclusion derived from the meeting.
It can also be used as a control mechanism to ask the participants to stick to the current hat.

**White Hat:** Neutral and objective.  
Just like a white paper, only the facts and figures. Nothing else.
> E.g: Last year there was 25% decrease in the meat sale because people are more health concerned.  

In the above example, the first part of the 25% decrease in sales is the fact, which fits for the white hat.
The second part of people buying less meat because they are health-conscious is interpretation, so it should not fall under the white hat.

**Red Hat:** Danger, Emotion.  
Under this hat, people can bring their emotional views to the table.
More importantly, there is *no need* to offer justification for why people feel that way.
These emotions should also be a part of the decision-making process, as they might change the way people think.  
> My red hat feeling tells me that we are being bullied into an agreement that we do not want.

**Black Hat:** Negativity.  
Spot out the weaknesses in the ideas logically. Critics are most welcome here, but with supporting logic.  
> Your conclusion doesn't follow what you have been telling us.

**Yellow Hat:** Sunshine, positivity.  
Optimism, making things happen, hope, proposals and suggestions.  
> There is abundant water in the mountains 50 miles away. Wouls it be feasible to put in a pipeline?  

**Green Hat:** Green, Vegetation, Creativity.  
New ideas, new perception. Allocate specific time to be creative to solve the problem.
It is fine, if no creative idea comes up. But it is very important to allocate the time to be creative.
> Cars should have square wheels.  
> Shoppers usually pay for the goods they buy. Lets reverse that. The store pays the customer.


They provide a good framework for a better decision making. Looking forward to using it in day-to-day life.
