# Books

## 1. Thinking, Fast and Slow (4.1*) <sub>24-Apr<sub>
On the first look, the book looked like a pillow, very thick, containing more than 450 pages.
Upon a good review by friends, I decided to delve in. I must admit that it is very dry, hard to read kind of a book.
It is similar to reading a research paper, need to devote my entire attention (System-2). 
No illustrative images/tables, like walking on bare foot in a hot summer.
This made me to prgress very slow, consuming a lot of weeks/months.

There are many “Aaha” moments, they made me reflect on myself as a decision maker, made me realize my irrational choices. 
There are pleanty of examples that provoke curiosity and put us in shame because of the cognitive error that one makes. 
From the following example, choose any one of them:

Option-A
> Would you accept a gamble that offers a 10% chance to win $95 and a 90% chance to lose $5?


Option-B
> Would you pay $5 to participate in a lottery that offers a 10% chance to win $100 and a 90% chance to win nothing?

For a rational mind, both options are the same. 
But most of the people in the survey preferred option B, because it is `framed` positive.
We might think that such trivial decisions won't have huge impact on life as a total.

For instance, if the person is in the position of choosing between having the surgery OR to seek alternative less promising approach, the following statements have different outcome even though they mean the same.
Writing-A 
> The one month survival rate is 90%.

Writing-B
> There is 10% mortality in the first month.

One scares us, while the other gives us hope. 
Of course majority of the people chose hope (Writing-A). 
This is also a trick used by advertisement agencies to manipulate people.

Overall, the book is indeed a gem, which changes the perspective of how we understand the world!
