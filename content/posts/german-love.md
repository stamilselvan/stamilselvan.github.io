When I was wondering what to write as first blog post, this inspiring incident flashed my mind which is worth sharing.

My neighbor, lets call him Herrman, is in his late 70’s, very little spoken, gentle man and living alone as his wife passed away few years ago. On a summer day when I was leaving my apartment, he also was leaving with flowers in hand. We greeted each other and the conversation went as follows:

Me: You are holding flowers, what’s special today?  
Herrman: Nothing special.  
Me: Are you going to Church or going to meet a friend?  
Herrman: No, I’m visiting my wife’s cemetery.  
Me: Is this your anniversary?  
Herrman: No.  
Me: How often do you visit your wife’s cemetery?  
Herrman: Everyday!  

I was speechless! I have indeed seen him going out everyday nevertheless of hot summer, freezing winter. Consistently doing this everyday since years. Also he never seek to find a new partner. He lives in the good memories of his wife. Herrman set the benchmark for Love. I wish his wife could have lived longer to share the happiness!
