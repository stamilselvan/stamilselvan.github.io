## Goal
To find out which market is best for a dumb long term investor OR to a monkey investor who throws a stone at the wall and picks the stock on it.

## Resource
https://www.tradingview.com/screener/ gives a good overview of the metrics.

## Methodology

<img src="MarketCompareExample.png" title="Markets Compare" width="650"> 

* Ratio computes how much percentage of the companies gave 10x in 10 years.
* USD adjusted ratio tells the same story, but the returns are adjusted to USD.

**Example:**  
In 2014 => 1 USD = 5.89 Vaenezuela Bolivar  
In 2024 => 10 USD = 36804.3 Vaenezuela Bolivar  
Growth = 36804.3 / 5.89 = 6248.61x  
To achieve 6248.61x returns, the stock should gain 624761%  
Number of companies that have >624761% are **5**  
USD Adjusted ratio = CompaniesWith10xInUsd/TotalCompanies = 5/31 = **16.13%**
