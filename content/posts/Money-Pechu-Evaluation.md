I was following the [Money Pechu](https://www.youtube.com/@MoneyPechu) youtube channel for some time, in which the economist Mr. Anand Srinivasan suggests the stocks to buy (or not) with his rationale.
The guy seems to be well versed in the market and looks like a disciplined investor. 
He is investing since decades and ecourages everyone to invest. 
His philosophy is that everyone can get rich by following disciplied living.

On the other hand, Mr. Buffet told that more than the 90% of the fund managers don't even match the market - [source](https://www.justetf.com/en/news/passive-investing/the-proof-that-active-managers-cannot-beat-the-market.html). 
As Mr. Srinivasan also kind of a fund manager suggesting stocks, I'm here attempting to evaluate the effectiveness of his suggestions.

## Evaluation Method
1. I try to fetch all the suggestions he is proving beginning 2024-Jan-01.
1. [Sensex returns](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/waiting-for-sensex-to-climb-peak-100000-sensex-tri-has-scaled-it-by-now-11016971.html) 15.5% for the last 20 years period. This will be used as a benchmark.
1. If the suggested stock grows at least 15.5% YoY after/within 3 years, the suggestion will be considered as successful. Failure otherwise.

## Progress Tracking and Outcome
The analysis can be found [>>here<<](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jQtehTzcSdOa0IfrXwWwOPZrzj7ZpHnpa00dIILTEVM/edit?usp=drive_link). It will be updated on regular interval.
